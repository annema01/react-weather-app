Forcast:
    - move main API call to App.js and pass info as props to the weather.js component
    - get the API call for forcast
    - get all the data
    - format:
        - time (day of the week)
        - number rounded
        - icons
    - loop to get the five days


Refactoring:
    - Create folder:
        - css
        - jsx
            organise jsx by hierachy 
    - Adjust css file and classNames (some component don't have their main css className created)

Feature to add:
    - change units for some of the infos
    - Error pop up if the data entered returns Not found
    - add air polution API (using the coords)
    - Localisation button
    - Night icons (find a way to color diff. part of svg?)
