Refactoring:
    - Adjust css file and classNames (some component don't have their main css className created)

Feature to add:

    - Error pop up if the data entered returns Not found
    - add air polution API (using the coords)
    - Localisation button
    - Night icons (find a way to color diff. part of svg?)
