Refactoring:
    - Adjust css file and classNames (some component don't have their main css className created)

Feature to add:

    - Error pop up if the data entered returns Not found


    - Night icons (find a way to color diff. part of svg?)
        - switch between moon phases
        - remake css root for most colors (and create a night version to add to the converting function)
